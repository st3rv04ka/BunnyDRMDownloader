# BunnyDRM Video Downloader

This repository contains a Bash script to download videos from BunnyDRM.

## Requirements

- **N_m3u8DL-RE**: Links must be generated from **The Stream Detector** browser extension.
- **Bash Shell** (Linux/Mac)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Input File**  
   Create a `to_extract.txt` file in the project directory. Insert the links (in the `N_m3u8DL-RE` format) generated by **The Stream Detector**. Each link should be on its own line.

2. **Adjust the Video Output Directory**  
   Open the `process.sh` file and locate the line where the download directory is specified. Update this path to the directory where you want your videos to be saved. For example:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /home/user/Videos/Bunny\ CDN/.[!.]*
   ```
   Replace /home/user/Videos/Bunny\ CDN/ with your preferred output folder.

3. **Run the Script**
    From the project directory, run:
    ```bash
    bash process.sh
    ```
    The script will read the links from to_extract.txt and begin downloading the videos.

4. **Check the Output**
    Once the script completes, your videos will be available in the configured output directory. Review the output logs for any errors or warnings.
